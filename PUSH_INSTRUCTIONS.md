# Push to GitHub

I have staged and committed all your files, including:
- PostgreSQL migration scripts
- Backup scripts (`backup_database.bat`, `restore_database.bat`)
- The restored `database.py` file
- Updated `.gitignore`

## How to Push

Since I don't have your GitHub credentials, you need to run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push origin main
```

If it asks for a username and password:
1. **Username:** Your GitHub username (`victorcode27`)
2. **Password:** Your **Personal Access Token** (not your login password).

If you don't have a token, you can generate one in GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens.

Once pushed, your code will be safe on GitHub!
